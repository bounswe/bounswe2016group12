-- Test Plan --

-----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

This document is a draft, and shall be made into a test_plan.md eventually
with its own GitHub Wiki page.

Style:
1) Usage of singular "they" shall be prefferred over "he/she".
2) Use 60 many dashes to separate between subsections.
3) Use 2 rows of 60 many dashes to separate between sections.

Considerations:
1) We may group the test cases according to their modules.
2) We may sort the test cases according to their priorities.
