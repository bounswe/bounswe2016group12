<div class="textblock"><p>The company that developed vis.js for the main part, <em>almende</em> is ./we_need_help.md "not able to maintain the project at the moment". So help from the community is very needed and welcome!</p>
<h2>There are many ways to help:</h2>
<h3>Answering questions</h3>
<p>There are new <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AQuestion+sort%3Acreated-desc">issues with questions</a> how to use vis.js opened almost every day. Be part of the community and help answer them!</p>
<p>A better way to ask questions on how to use vis.js is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/vis.js">stackoverflow</a>. Questions are posed here also and need to be answered by the community. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/vis.js">Please help answering questions</a> here also.</p>
<h3>Closing old issues</h3>
<p>A new issue is often opened fast and then forgotten. Please help go trough <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc">the old issues</a> (especially the <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3AQuestion">questions</a>) and ask the creator of the issues if the problem still exists before closing the issue. The support team uses the <b>issue inactive</b> label to mark these issues.</p>
<h3>Improve the webpage</h3>
<p>The visjs.org webpage is hosted on the <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/tree/gh-pages">gh-pages branch</a>. If you find a typo or anything else that should be improved feel free to create a pull-request to <em>gh-pages</em>. Please make changes in your own fork of gh-pages so the support team can view the changes in your hosted fork.</p>
<h3>Create new examples</h3>
<p>We have <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/tree/develop/examples">a collection of examples</a>. Please help by creating interesting new ones that show a specific problem or layout. Keep the examples easy to understand for beginners and remove unnecessary clutter.</p>
<h3>Provide interesting showcases</h3>
<p>If you use vis.js to develop something beautiful feel free to create a pull-request to our show cases page in the gh-pages branch](//github.com/almende/vis/tree/gh-pages/showcase). <a href="http://visjs.org/showcase/index.html">These showcases are displayed on our webpage</a> and we are always looking for new examples.</p>
<h3>Confirming and fixing bugs</h3>
<p>Every software has bugs. We also have <a href="https://github.com/almende/vis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABug+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">quite a nice collection</a> ;-) Feel free to fix as many bugs as you want!</p>
<p>You can not only help by fixing bugs, but also by confirming the bug or even creating a minimal code example to prove this bug exists.</p>
<h3>Implementing Feature-Requests</h3>
<p>A lot of people have a lot of ideas for improving vis.js. <a href="https://github.com/almende/vis/labels/Feature-Request">We label these issues as <b>Feature-Request</b></a>. Feel free to implement a new feature by creating a new Pull-Request.</p>
<p><a href="//github.com/almende/vis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22For+everyone%21%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">Some issues are labeled <b>For everybody!</b></a>. These are a good starting point.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Pull-Requests</h3>
<p>We use <a href="//help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/">GitHub's two-step review</a> to make sure pull-requests are clean. You can help by checking out pull-request branches and testing them. You also can comment on lines of code and make sure the pull-request introduces no new bugs or typos.</p>
<h2>Creating Pull Requests</h2>
<p>There are some rules for pull-request:</p>
<ul>
<li>All pull-request must be to the <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/tree/develop">develop-branch</a>. Pull-request against the <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/tree/master">master-branch</a> must be closed. (Changes to <a href="//github.com/almende/vis/tree/gh-pages">gh-pages</a> are also ok.)</li>
<li>Only commit changes done in the source files in the folder <code>lib</code>, not to the builds which are located in the folder <code>dist</code>.</li>
<li>Keep your changes small and clear. Only work on one topic at one time and only change lines of code that you have to change to reach your goal.</li>
<li>Test your changes before creating a pull-request. The easiest way is to open the existing examples and playing with them.</li>
<li>If you are fixing or implementing an existing issue, please refer to it in the description and in the commit message.</li>
<li>If you are introducing a new feature, add some documentation and a new example to make it easy to adapt.</li>
<li>If you introduce breaking changes, like changing the signature of a public function, point that out in your description. Breaking changes result in a new major release.</li>
<li>Always adapt to the code style of the existing source. Never adapt existing code to your personal taste. :trollface:</li>
<li>Pull-requests must be reviewed by at least two member of the support team. The First must approve the pull-request, the second can than merge after also checking it.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Happy Helping!!</b> </p>
