  "body": "# Welcome to Meanco\r\n\r\n### _\"So much internet, so little time\"_. \r\n\r\nMeanco, or as we like to call it, **Meaningful Connections**, is a project currently being developed for both web and android. The aim is to collect information about inter-related subjects across global users. \r\n\r\nUser will be able to introduce topics, typed relationships between topics, add tags with context (semantic tagging) to the topics and supporting resources and conversations surrounding these subjects. Semantic search, subject tracking, and recommendation for both users and content are important aspects for our project.\r\n\r\n### A user asks:\r\n\r\n* _Why do I care about your project? What makes it different from other crowdsourcing, information-based apps (such as eksisozluk)?_\r\n\r\nFirst of all, website and android design is awesome - you will certainly enjoy surfing in our graph view. More importantly, the information is not scattered around the application, the topics are linked to each other so that if you want to read about a specific information, you will see the information related to that in one place, tidied up. You won't find yourself watching cat videos while studying for your physics exam (...we hope).\r\n\r\n* _Why is semantic tagging important?_\r\n\r\nWe were tired of nitpicking among hairs (what?) of information. We want to avoid seeing the Unforgiven movie while reading information about Unforgiven from Metallica, or seeing python the snake while learning about coding, or eeing Mesut Yılmaz the football player while doing your history homework. \r\n\r\n* _That's all I will ask for now. Thank you! Good luck!_      \r\n\r\nWell, thank _you_. You will make our site awesome. We are just providing you the infrastructure.  \r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\n\r\nHere is our [Wiki]( https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki), if you want to learn more about our development details (e.g. [requirements](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Requirements), [mockups](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Mockups)).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWeb team:\r\n* [Ahmet Ercan Tekden](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Ahmet-Ercan-Tekden)\r\n* [Esma Özelbaş](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Esma-Özelbaş)\r\n* [İsmail Enes Yılmaz](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/İsmail-Enes-Yılmaz)\r\n* [İrem Zöğ](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/İrem-Zöğ)\r\n* [Kayahan Taşyaran](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Kayahan-Taşyaran)\r\n* [Mehmet Utkan Gezer](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Mehmet-Utkan-Gezer)\r\n\r\nAndroid team:\r\n* [Ezgi Tekdemir](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Ezgi-Tekdemir)\r\n* [Furkan Erdem Perşembe](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2016group12/wiki/Furkan-Erdem-Perşembe)\r\n",
